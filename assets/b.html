How to Build a Responsive Bootstrap Website?
If you are new to the web and want to learn how to build a responsive bootstrap website, then you are in the right place. In this tutorial, we will be going through a detailed step-by-step guide on how you make your site responsive using bootstrap.

Bootstrap to the rescue
For those who don’t know about Bootstrap — it is a popular CSS framework that can be used to create the front-end of a website, i.e., design. It is flexible enough to let you build a website with your requirements and can be tweaked accordingly.

As you might know, building a responsive website is a core requirement. Any site that doesn’t tick the responsiveness feature suffers from poor user experience and also rankings as Google doesn’t like websites that are not user-friendly.

No need to be an expert
To build a responsive website, you don’t need to be an expert. The use of Bootstrap makes it possible to easily develop a responsive website as it doesn’t require you to play with specific CSS Grid specifications or Flexbox.

Before we move on the tutorial itself, let’s learn what Responsive Bootstrap Website means.

What is a responsive website?
A responsive website means that the site can be opened on multiple screen sizes that are relevant to all kind of devices that we use daily. The ability to showcase your website to a wide variety of people with diverse devices means improved user experience.

How to Build a Responsive Bootstrap Website?
Awesome! With all the background knowledge equipped, we are now ready to go with the tutorial itself. Let’s begin.

Note: You can use a simple text editor and a browser to get the website ready. However, if you want to explore how it will function as a real website, then we recommend you to check out free VPS such as Amazon Web Services, and get your website online. This way you can check its behavior on different systems or browsers.

Basic Setup
Step 1: Viewport and initial scale

The first step is to set up a responsive Bootstrap properly. It can be done by simply putting the code in your web pages.

<meta name=”viewport” content=”width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
The above code defines a meta tag that tells the browser to set the width of the website according to the device width. It also set scaling to 1 which equates to default website. In short, we tell the browser that we are going to build a responsive website.

Step 2: Hooking up Bootstrap

Now, it is time to link Bootstrap libraries. It can be done by simply using the code below. To make the code work, you also need to download Bootstrap to your development folder and extract it. It will create two folders within your main development folder as shown in the image below.


Now use the following code and put it in the index.html file below the viewpoint meta tag.

<link rel=”stylesheet” href=”css/bootstrap.css”>
<link rel=”stylesheet” href=”css/bootstrap-responsive.css”>
Starting the Building Process
Depending on what hosting solution you are using, whether it be Amazon S3, a dedicated or shared hosting plan, or even through your own in-house hosting, as long as you are using these same tools and commands, you should be fine in setting this process up. A responsive website can be divided into five major components. As we are building a responsive website, the main components are as follows.

1. Navigation
2. Information area
3. Contents section
4. Right Sidebar
5. Footer.

Step 1: Getting the navigation up

The navigation stays at the top of the website. Apart from that, it can also contain other vital information such as the website name. To ensure that it works, you need to use the “navbar” class as shown in the code below.

<nav class=”navbar fixed-top navbar-expand-md navbar-light bg-light”>
As you can see, have also used other classes such as fixed-top, navbar-light, bg-light and so on. These control the text nature, its background and so on.

Now, let’s add more code.

<nav class=”navbar fixed-top navbar-expand-md navbar-light bg-light”>
 <div class=”container”>
<! — more navigation code here →
</div>
</nav>
The above code defines a container div which we can use it to store and manipulate the navigation content.

<nav class=”navbar fixed-top navbar-expand-md navbar-light bg-light”>
 <div class=”container”>
 <a class=”navbar-brand” href=”#”>Responsive Bootstrap Website</a>
 <button class=”navbar-toggler” type=”button” data-toggle=”collapse” data-target=”#navbarCollapse” aria-controls=”navbarCollapse” aria-expanded=”false” aria-label=”Toggle navigation”>
 <span class=”navbar-toggler-icon”></span>
 </button>
 <div class=”collapse navbar-collapse” id=”navbarCollapse”>
 <! — left navigation links →
 <ul class=”navbar-nav mr-auto”>
<! — active navigation link →
 <li class=”nav-item active”>
 <a class=”nav-link” href=”#”>Home
 <span class=”sr-only”>(current)</span>
 </a>
 </li>
<! — regular navigation link →
 <li class=”nav-item”>
 <a class=”nav-link” href=”#”>About</a>
 </li>
<! — more navigation links →
<li class=”nav-item”>
 <a class=”nav-link” href=”#”>Blog</a>
 </li>
</ul>
<! — right navigation link →
 <ul class=”nav navbar-nav ml-auto”>
 <li class=”nav-item”>
 <a class=”nav-link” href=”#”>Login</a>
 </li>
 <li class=”nav-item”>
 <a class=”nav-link” href=”#”>Register</a>
 </li>
</ul>
 </div>
